### 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction

Due to the desires of acquiring Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Chatbots should be built in a way that acts as a tool, a toy, and a friend at the same time <sup>[1]</sup>. It is not realized until OpenAI released ChatGPT 3.5 in November 30th in 2022. Even though, by now, ChatGPT has not fully achieved the dream of AGI, it shows the potential.

A chatbot was defined as "A computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users" <sup>[1]</sup>. For now, a more accurate definition is "A chatbot is representation of a Large Language Model (LLM) which integrates many other mechanisms, such as computer vision and robotics, while still an attempt to AGI". It is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

ChatGPT that has remarkable capabilities, such as text generation related to all known research fields is the key milestone in the path to AGI. This attempt raises people's great curiosity to future world with AI as well as fears. The purpose of this paper is to offer personal thoughts on chatbots and the future of a world with chatbots. In section 2, we take a glance at current abilities of existing chatbots and compare them to human beings if possible. In section 3, we present other people's concerns of AI. In section 4, we review the main technique in LLM to make a conclusion to future development of chatbots.
