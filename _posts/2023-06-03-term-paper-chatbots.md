### 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction

Due to the desires of acquiring Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Chatbots should be built in a way that acts as a tool, a toy, and a friend at the same time <sup>[1]</sup>. It is not realized until OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 30th in 2022. Even though, by now, ChatGPT has not fully achieved the dream of AGI, it shows the potential.

A chatbot was defined as “A computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users” <sup>[1]</sup>. For now, a more accurate definition is “A chatbot is representation of a Large Language Model (LLM) which integrates many other mechanisms, such as computer vision and robotics, while still an attempt to AGI”. It is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

ChatGPT that has remarkable capabilities, such as text generation related to all known research fields is the key milestone in the path to AGI. This attempt raises people’s great curiosity to future world with AI as well as fears. The purpose of this paper is to offer personal thoughts on chatbots and the future of a world with chatbots. In section 2, we take a glance at current abilities of existing chatbots and the future plans of provident businesses. In section 3, we present other people’s concerns of AI and review the main technique in LLM to make a conclusion to future development of chatbots.

### 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abilities

Represented by ChatGPT and Midjourney that is used in Discord, chatbots have shown outstanding abilities in many fields related to digital text and digital images. In the first part of this section, we focus on ChatGPT whose killer feature is text generation. In the second part, we focus on the state-of-art applications and reachable expectations of AI.

In education field including mathematics and physics, ChatGPT’s performance can reach or even exceed the average level. Additionally, ChatGPT has tremendous potential in text classification tasks, as it can effectively address problems such as genre identification, sentiment analysis, stance detection, and more. In text generation and code generation, ChatGPT performs even better: it is hard for people to distinguish ChatGPT from real humans and ChatGPT is able to be used in both simple and complex programming tasks. However, in all fields, the chatbot might give plausible-sounding but incorrect information. <sup>[2]</sup> As the first light of AGI, if given accurate contexts, role playing context particularly, it is able to reply like a friend, a teacher and any other people, although there is no research specifying its performance in perceiving emotions. Overall, despite existed false response, ChatGPT cannot only offer human-like help in information but also in sentiments.

Due to the fantastic abilities of ChatGPT, we may reasonably make a conclusion that some people would be replaced by ChatGPT <sup>[3]</sup>. Furthermore, AI has been contained in many future plans of global corporations. Among them, Microsoft shows an unusual passion in AI. The global corporation launched many AI-powered copilots in its traditional products, such as Office 365 and Windows. Nvidia, a chip giant providing high performance graphics processing unit (GPU) to video games and AI exercises, imagined the future with AI: in video games, players will find non-player characters (NPCs) behaving human-like and the results of a single game may change depending on players’ interactions with NPCs. Overall, chatbots herald an imminent revolution of this era.

### 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns

The human-like performance of ChatGPT triggers concerns on AI. Some of them are from technics, while others are in the domain of ethos, which may even evolve into fears.

In terms of technics, people mostly worry about its development. Current chatbots faces certain limitations, such as insufficient understanding, energy consumption <sup>[2]</sup>. Additionally, since researchers have little knowledge about why LLMs show emergent abilities that are essential to the huge leap of ChatGPT at a certain computational scale, the scale of parameters, it is not fair to optimistically predict that in the future, the capabilities of LLMs will continuously increase rather than stay at this level <sup>[4]</sup>. This abrupt advance in LLM research arouses researchers’ interests <sup>[2]</sup>. However, it is not reasonable to say that researchers will soon figure out what happens in LLMs since the training data is a tremendous amount. Overall, the limited understanding currently, predictable huge energy consumption and unpredictable result-oriented LLMs result in people’s concerns in AI’s development.

In term of ethos, the concerns are even stronger. In May 31st in 2023, AI experts and public figures, including CEO of OpenAI, said that “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war. <sup>[5]</sup>” It seems that the risk of extinction brought by AI is closer than any other era. When it comes to security issues related to AI, a scenery of AI-powered robots killing humans may come up. However, by now, AI has not developed to that extent. The risks of extinction are mainly from the usage in cheating and breaking laws, because the data used in LLMs is invisible and the output of LLMs is unpredictable. The concerns focus on copyright, false information, malicious usage, bias and discrimination, privacy and data security <sup>[3]</sup>. Since AI is a new application of technology, the regulations and laws are not determined. For example, what if a chatbot shows an undisguised discrimination against a country, a race? Besides, there have been many applications of AI porn and cheating which might be malicious. Overall, the concerns of ethos are not fictional but realistic, which require policymakers and the public to enact laws to restrict the use of AI. Of course, it costs time.

### 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion

This paper reviews the revolution of chatbots, highlighting their potential role in the development of AGI. It discusses the abilities demonstrated by chatbots such as ChatGPT and highlights the interest and investment in AI by major corporations which imagine the future of a world with AI. However, concerns are raised regarding the development of chatbots, including technical concerns and ethical concerns, both of which will slow down the development of AI.
