description: Writing for what, how to write along with an tentative essay.

***TODO***: Too busy these days, I will write this blog in next Monday.

The thoughts about writing come from [Leadership Lab of UChicago](https://youtu.be/vtIzMaLkCaM) that is about academic writing, which is also suitable in general writing from my perspective.For now, I only watch one Ep.1. However, in my conception of this blog, I need to watch two videos, and then write an essay about tagging and ideology.
