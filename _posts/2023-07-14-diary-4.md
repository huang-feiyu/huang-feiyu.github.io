description: Thoughts about individuals and communication.

A question is hovering in my mind: is it just because I cannot admit myself (personality, education, class, …), or because indeed, there is a strong desire driving myself to address the big problem that is “how can we really understand another individual” ?

TODO: This post is full of confusion. The reason why I do not write in Chinese is that in previous post, I announced that I would be a pragmatist and devoted myself into real world. Evidently, this post breaks the vulnerable “law”.

I am just confused about myself and this blog: who are the target readers of this blog? what is the real meaning of so-called *individual* in my context? how do we communicate without any burden?
